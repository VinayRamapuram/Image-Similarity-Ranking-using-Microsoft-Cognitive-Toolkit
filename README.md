# Image-Similarity-Ranking-using-Microsoft-Cognitive-Toolkit
A large number of problems in the computer vision domain can be solved by ranking images according to their similarity.  
For example retail companies want to show customers products which are similar to the ones bought in the past. Or companies with large amounts of data want to organize and search their images effectively. 
Ranker using Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK). 
Traditionally, computer vision solutions required expert knowledge to identify and implement so called “features” which highlight desired information in images.  At present, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are used to automatically find these features. DNNs lead to a huge improvement in the field and can be used for a large range of problems, including image classification, object detection, or image similarity. 
1. Train and evaluate an image similarity ranking system 
2. Annotate your own dataset by scraping images from the net, how to use these images to train an image similarity model for your specific use case, and what parameters and design decisions are important to achieve good results. 
3. Publish the trained model as a web service or Rest API to Azure.
